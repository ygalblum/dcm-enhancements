# Policy API & Execution Engine

## Summary

This ADR defines the Management and Execution API and Workflow of the DCM Policy
Engine

## Motivation

The Policy Engine operates as a specialized microservice within the Data Center
Management (DCM) application responsible for governing service creation and
modification (e.g., VirtualMachines, Containers). It enables Admins,
Tenant-Admins, and Users to inject logic that validates (Approve/Reject),
mutates (Defaulting/Altering) and assigns Service Providers to request payloads
using Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Rego.

### Goal

Define the flow of how Policies are managed and used by the Policy Engine

- Define Policy types - Global, Tenant, User
- Define Policy management
  - How policies should be added/updated
  - How policies will be stored
- Define Policy execution
  - Policy priority
  - Value immutability and constraints
- Determine the enforcement engine and policy language
  - For V1, [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs) and
    [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/policy-language)) will be used
  - Other alternatives may be considered in future versions
- Define the input format
- Define the output format

### Non-Goals

- Policy implementation
- Actionable OpenAPI specification
- While this ADR references `Tenant` level `Policy` and `ID`, `Tenants` are not
  supported in V1

## Core Concepts & Definitions

### Policy Responsibilities

Every policy may return one or more of the following outputs

1. **Reject:** Requests are approved by default. Policies may decide whether the
   request should be _Rejected_.
2. **Mutation:** Modifying the request payload (e.g., injecting default labels)
   by providing a patch map.
3. **Field Constraints:** Defining the mutability of fields for _subsequent_
   policies in the chain.
4. **Service Provider Selection:** Policies may set a value and/or constraints

### Policy Scope & Hierarchy (Execution Order)

The execution order is strictly determined by **Level** first, then
**Priority**.

1. **Global:** (Super Admin) - Runs first.
2. **Tenant:** (Tenant Admin) - Runs second.
3. **User:** (End User) - Runs last.

_Within each level, policies are sorted by priority: lower integers indicate
higher priority._

### The "Rego Contract"

#### Input

The input payload includes:

- `spec` - The current patched request payload
  - Assumption - While policies do not have to be specific for Service Types
    they will need to know the expected content
- `constraints` - The current constraints context (accumulated from prior
  policies)
- `provider` - The currently selected service provider (empty string initially,
  populated as policies are evaluated)
- `service_provider_constraints` - The current service provider constraints
  (accumulated from prior policies)

#### Output

Following the policy responsibilities, the output should be comprised of the
following elements

- **rejected** (bool) - since requests are approved by default, policies may
  reject them.
- **rejection_reason** (string, optional) - reason for rejection
- **selected_provider** (string, optional) - the name of the service provider
  chosen to fulfill the request
- **service_provider_constraints** (object, optional) -
  - `allow_list` - list of allowed service provider names
  - `patterns` - list of regex patterns for matching allowed providers
- **patch** (map, optional) - a dictionary of the corresponding service type for
  setting values. Each internal key is optional
- **constraints** (map, optional) - follows
  [JSON Schema (draft 2020-12)](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation).

  This standard supports:
  - Immutable: _const_
  - Numeric constraints: _minimum, maximum, multipleOf_
  - String patterns: _pattern, minLength, maxLength_
  - Enumerations: _enum_
  - Array constraints: _minItems, maxItems_
  - Conditional logic: _if/then/else_

  For the complete validation vocabulary, see the
  [JSON Schema Validation specification](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation).

### Policy Code Ownership and Responsibilities

- DCM Admins, Tenant-Admins and Users implement the policies' REGO code
- DCM Admins, Tenant-Admins and Users are responsible for correct registration
  of the policies
- DCM Admins, Tenant-Admins and Users are responsible for the accuracy and
  performance of the policies
- Trying to register a REGO code snipet that fails compilation will fail

## System Architecture

The Policy API serves two distinct functions:

1. Management Plane: CRUD operations for Policy definitions and synchronization
   with the Policy Engine.
2. Execution Plane: Service requests evaluation against active policies using a
   stored-policy model.

### Policy Management

#### Policy Registration Flow

    participant User
    participant PolicyEngine
    participant Database
    participant OPA

    User->>PolicyEngine: POST /api/v1/policies
    PolicyEngine->>Database: Check unique Name and Priority for policy type
    alt Uniqueness check failed
        PolicyEngine-->>User: Error response
    else Uniqueness check passed
        PolicyEngine->>PolicyEngine: Generate UUID
        PolicyEngine->>PolicyEngine: Parse PackageName
        PolicyEngine->>Database: Store policy metadata
        Note right of Database: UUID, Name, PackageName,<br/>LabelSelector, Policy Type, Priority
        PolicyEngine->>OPA: Push REGO code with UUID
        alt REGO compilation failed
            OPA-->>PolicyEngine: Compilation error
            PolicyEngine->>Database: Rollback stored metadata
            PolicyEngine-->>User: Error response
        else REGO compilation succeeded
            OPA-->>PolicyEngine: Success
            PolicyEngine-->>User: Return UUID
        end
    end
```

#### Pseudo API

##### POST /api/v1/policies

###### Payload

- Name
  - Must be unique at its level. That is:
    - All global policies must have unique names
    - All tenant policies must have unique names within their tenant
    - All user policies must have unique names for their user
- Policy Matching Criteria. Treated with AND.
  - Label Selector
- Policy Type
  - Global, Tenant, User
- Priority
  - Must be unique at its level
  - A lower number means a higher priority and therefore will be evaluated first
- REGO Code
- Enabled
  - Optional. Default `true`

###### Response Payload

- Generated UUID

###### Execution Logic & Flow

- Validate the Policy Name and Priority
  - If not unique return an error
- Generate a UUID
- Get the policy package name from the REGO code
- Store the following information in the DB
  - UUID
  - Name
  - Package Name
  - Policy Type
  - Priority
  - Label Selector
- Push the REGO code to OPA
  - Use the UUID for naming to avoid collisions
  - If failed, rollback DB and return an error
- Return UUID to caller

##### GET /api/v1/policies

Return the list of policies. Allow for filtering

##### GET /api/v1/policies/{policyId}

Return the specific policy

##### DELETE /api/v1/policies/{policyId}

Delete the specific policy

##### PUT /api/v1/policies/{policyId}

Update the specific policy. Policy name and type are immutable

###### Payload

- Policy Matching Criteria
- Priority
- REGO Code
- Enabled

### Execution Plane

#### Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant PlacementManager
    participant PolicyEngine
    participant Database
    participant OPA

    User->>PlacementManager: Create Service request
    PlacementManager->>PolicyEngine: Validate Payload
    PolicyEngine->>Database: Get matching policies by serviceType and labelSelector
    Database-->>PolicyEngine: List of policies

    loop For each policy
        PolicyEngine->>OPA: Evaluate policy
        OPA-->>PolicyEngine: Policy result
        PolicyEngine->>PolicyEngine: Enforce constraints
        PolicyEngine->>PolicyEngine: Mutate payload
        alt Policy rejected or constraint violation
            PolicyEngine-->>PlacementManager: Request rejected
            PlacementManager-->>User: Request rejected
        end
    end

    PolicyEngine-->>PlacementManager: Success with updated payload
    PlacementManager-->>User: Service created
```

#### Pseudo API

##### POST /api/v1alpha1/policies:evaluateRequest

###### Payload

- Service Instance
  - spec - the service specification (flexible schema)

###### Execution Logic & Flow

The Engine acts as an orchestrator. It does not send Rego code during
evaluation; it calls pre-loaded modules in OPA.

###### _Pipeline Logic (The "Chain of Responsibility")_

- The Policy API maintains a `ConstraintContext` map in memory for the duration
  of the request.
- Fetch & Sort:
  - Query DB for enabled policies matching the request payload based on the
    policy’s matching criteria.
  - Sort by Level (Global -> Tenant -> User) then Priority (Desc).
- If no policies matching the request payload were found, the request will
  return successfully
- Iterate for each policy P:
  - Call `OPA`:
    - Invoke /v1/data/<P.PackageName>/main
    - Pass
      - `spec` - the current patched request payload
      - `provider` - the currently selected service provider
      - `constraints` - the accumulated constraint context (if any)
      - `service_provider_constraints` - the accumulated SP constraints (if any)
  - Check `Reject`
    - If `Reject` is `true`, ABORT IMMEDIATELY (Fail Fast). Return 406.
  - Validate `Constraints`:
    - A lower-level policy cannot "unlock" a field locked by a higher-level
      policy.
    - If it does, ABORT with "Policy Conflict Error"
  - Update `ConstraintContext`:
    - Merge new `Constraints` from Policy P into `ConstraintContext`.
  - Validate `Patch`:
    - Validate `Patch` against `ConstraintContext`.
    - Example: If `ConstraintContext.region` is immutable and Policy P tries to
      patch the `region`, ABORT with "Policy Conflict Error"
  - Apply `Patch`
    - Update service_payload with valid patches.
  - Validate `ServiceProvider`
    - If Policy P returned a `selected_provider` and
      `service_provider_constraints` exist, validate the selected provider
      against the constraints.

- Finalize: Return the final payload, selected provider, and status to
  Placement Manager.
  - Status is `APPROVED` if the payload was not modified, `MODIFIED` if any
    patches were applied.

###### _Constraint Validation Example_

- Step 1 (Global Policy):
  - Patch: {"billing_tag": "engineering"}
  - Constraint: {"billing_tag": {"mode": "immutable"}}
  - Result: Payload has billing_tag. Context has billing_tag=immutable.
- Step 2 (User Policy):
  - Patch: {"billing_tag": "marketing"}
  - Action: Engine checks Context. billing_tag is immutable.
- Result: Error. The User policy violates the Global constraint.
